====== Setting Up Your Door43 ======

This is the default home page for Door43 testing environment that you will see before setting up your copy to be like production. Here are the steps you need to take:

   1. Copy conf/acl.auth.php.dist to conf/acl.auth.php

   2. Copy conf/users.auth.php.dist to conf/users.auth.php (you can now login as admin, password admin)

   3. Copy conf/local_private.php.dist to local_private.php (this will set the media and pages dirs to data/gitrepo)

   4. Go get the repos with git (more information to come)
